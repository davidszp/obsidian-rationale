# Rationale

**A thoughtful Obsidian theme for writers, researchers, and academics.**

![Rationale Theme](assets/rationale%20theme.png)

Rationale creates a calm, focused environment for deep work. Four carefully crafted color schemes adapt to your mood and context—from pure monochrome for distraction-free writing to warm, inviting palettes for long research sessions.

## Why Rationale?

Most themes optimize for aesthetics. Rationale optimizes for **the work**.

- **Serif body text** reduces eye strain during extended reading and writing
- **Clean visual hierarchy** helps you navigate complex documents
- **Monochrome icons** keep your attention on content, not chrome
- **Multiple schemes** for different contexts—focused writing, evening research, or professional presentations

## Color Schemes

Rationale includes four distinct schemes, each available in light and dark modes:

| Scheme | Character |
|--------|-----------|
| **Academic** | Monochrome—black, white, grey |
| **Anthropic** | Warm cream, terracotta accents |
| **Nordic** | Cool blue-grays, frost highlights |
| **Old Money** | Warm ivory, walnut, bronze |

Switch schemes instantly via Style Settings. Each scheme maintains consistent readability while offering a distinct atmosphere.

## Features

### Typography System

Rationale pairs fonts intentionally:

- **Body**: Source Serif 4—optimized for extended reading
- **Headings**: Space Grotesk—modern geometric sans-serif for clear hierarchy
- **Code**: JetBrains Mono—ligatures and excellent distinction from prose

All fonts are customizable. Bring your own typography via Style Settings.

### Writer-Focused Details

- **Extended checkbox states** — 20+ task statuses with monochrome outline icons (`[/]` in-progress, `[>]` deferred, `[?]` question, `[!]` important, and more)
- **Refined callouts** — scheme-aware styling that complements rather than distracts
- **Justified text option** — for that published-document feel
- **Focus mode** — hide UI elements for immersive writing
- **Cards layout** — transform dataview tables into visual grids
