# Rationale

A minimalist, professional Obsidian theme with multiple color schemes and extensive customization.

## Design Philosophy

Rationale prioritizes **clarity and focus**. The design draws inspiration from academic publishing and professional writing environments:

- **Serif body text** for comfortable long-form reading
- **Sans-serif headings** for clear visual hierarchy
- **Restrained color palettes** that don't distract from your writing
- **Thoughtful defaults** with deep customization available

## Color Schemes

| Scheme | Light | Dark |
|--------|-------|------|
| **Academic** | Pure monochrome — black, white, grey | Dark monochrome with soft contrast |
| **Anthropic** | Warm cream backgrounds, terracotta accents | Warm charcoal with terracotta highlights |
| **Nordic** | Cool blue-grays inspired by Nord | Polar night with frost accents |

## Features

### Typography
- **Body**: Source Serif 4 — optimized for extended reading
- **Headings**: Space Grotesk — modern geometric sans-serif
- **Code**: JetBrains Mono — ligatures and clear distinction

All fonts are customizable via Style Settings.
